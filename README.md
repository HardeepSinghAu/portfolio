## Target audience
The target audience for this website is a potential employer. The wireframe shows my ambitions and designs for the website and the website itself showcases my skills and abilities. By presenting both the wireframe and the website any user can see the gap in my skills but also my soft-skills such as critical thinking, positivity and work ethic to make the concept actualise into reality as best as possible. 

## Tech stack 
- HTML
- CSS
- Github
- Netlify
- Balsamiq

## Planning Stages

I created a to-do list on paper for general tasks and a large task-list specifically for the website only. This was **always** by my side whilst working on the project. I could easily access and view what needed to be done, but also jot down new tasks as they were recalled and remain focused whilst keeping the momentum going on the project. The tasks on the Portfolio project list, were given a prioirty rating from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the highest priority. I felt this was a good system that worked personally for me. However when working in a team, something more accessible online such as a **Trello board** would serve better.

I used Balsamiq to draft wireframes of my portfolio across all pages in the different viewports.
