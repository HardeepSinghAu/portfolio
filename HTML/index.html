                <p>Having formally studied Biomedical Sciences at Kings College London and graduating 
                    at the peak of the GFC, I found myself in Sales for 7 plus years followed by another 7 plus as a stay at home parent. 
                    I possess a variety of skills such as negotiating with CEOs of multi-million dollar companies 
                    and more dauntingly 3 year olds who don't want to take their naps. On a serious note, I am 
                    excellent at understanding clients needs, negotiating where required and producing stand-out results.
                    
                    I am an excellent communicator and I believe this starts with listening first, understanding 
                    the problem before providing a solution. I'm great at handling objections and building a 
                    rapport with clients and colleagues alike. 
                    
                <p class="hideMobile">I used to play the Sitar, which has unfortunately taken a back seat since having children. However,
                    I still enjoy dabbling on a keyboard and coding along to Sitar pieces in the background. My
                    newest hobby, which I discovered during lockdowns, is gardening. Never, did I imagine, that I would
                    enjoy gardening and find it relaxing.</p>

                <p>I am a Mum to 3 young kids who have been the center of my universe since 2014, therefore a big part
                    of my identity. This past year, I have been working on small projects to find out who I am. These have included,
                    volunteering, freelancing as an Event Planner for clients who needed to plan quick weddings (thanks covid). 
                    And most importantly learning. Learning to grow certain plants, learning to balance work and family and Learning to Code.</p>
